# Regression Models(ML Coursework Project)

This assignment project is about analyzing car fuel efficencies using visualizations and building Regression Models(Linear Regression,Polynomial Regression,Logistic Regression).

The programming Language was use in python and python ML libraries that were used are:
- numpy for mathematical formulas
- pandas for reading datasets
- scikit-learn for preprocessing,training,testing and building Regression models
- seaborn for correlation visualization uses heatmap to about dataset attributes and their correlation.
- matplotlib to see the plot visualization of the regression models and the datasets.
